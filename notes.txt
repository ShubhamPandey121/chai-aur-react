// lecture 3 
=>in vite the project the jsx fill is used only 
where as in that basicReact i.e npx run  we can use "js" as well as "jsx"\
also on importing the function as name we use can use only first letter as capital in both basic react as well as vite one

=>in basic react we use s for complete javascript file i.e the file where no html is returned and if html is returned then we use jsx

//lecture 4
=>we had learn how does actually react work , in this lecture we learned and maked our custom react
=>so basically we learn how the babel convert the imported function and also we learn that </App> this is basically a syntax 
which is further converted by babel according to his need 
=> we can directly use function which is made inside that by calling it or by using above syntax
=>so these function are basically returning some html file ,so these function are giving the html for rendering 
=>hence we can also directlty do this by storing html into the container like in our code we had used anotherElement.
=>we can also reduce one step for babel by using js for means javascript convert those html[jsx] into the js so we can also
 reduce that step which we had done reactElement

 note:-
 =>Babel is a JavaScript compiler â€” a tool that transforms your modern JavaScript and JSX code into older JavaScript that browsers can understand.
